package crawl

// archive.go — every page we fetch is kept, so a crawl is a corpus rather than a
// throwaway. Kept pages can be re-read without paying the network again, indexed
// for search, and built against later.
//
// It rides whatever object store the host already has — anything with Get and
// Put. No second client and no second set of credentials: tenant isolation is the
// scope-derived KEY PREFIX, which is exactly the shape this needs.
//
// FETCH AND KEEP ARE SEPARATE. Fetch is the pure network primitive: URL in, Page
// out, no IO beyond the request, which is what makes it testable without a store.
// Read is the entry point callers use — archive first, network second, keep what
// came back. One entry point, so no caller has to remember to persist and no two
// callers can disagree about where pages live.
//
// Best-effort by construction: a store that is absent, unreachable or slow costs a
// cache hit and nothing else. Crawling must not start failing because the corpus
// is down — that would trade a working feature for a bookkeeping one.
