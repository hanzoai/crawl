// Package crawl turns any web page into clean markdown a model can read.
//
// The engine is three orthogonal steps, each in its own file and each testable
// without the others:
//
//	Fetch    (this file)  URL   → HTML bytes, over guarded HTTP
//	extract  (extract.go) HTML  → the readable subtree + metadata
//	render   (markdown.go) node → markdown
//
// Read wraps Fetch with an archive (archive.go) and, for the pages a static read
// cannot see, a headless browser (browser.go).
//
// # Fetching untrusted URLs is the security boundary
//
// The caller supplies the URL, so this is a server-side request forgery primitive
// by construction. Run inside a network, a naive fetcher reaches private services
// and a cloud metadata endpoint on 169.254.169.254 that hands out credentials to
// anyone who asks — a credential exfiltration hole, not a bug. So this package
// carries the guard itself.
//
// So: only http/https, and every address actually dialed must be a public unicast
// address. The check is in the DIALER, not on the hostname, because checking a
// hostname up front and then letting the transport resolve it again is a
// time-of-check/time-of-use gap — DNS rebinding walks straight through it. Dialing
// is the only moment the real destination is known, and that is where it is
// enforced. Redirects are followed but re-enter the same dialer, so a public URL
// that 302s to 169.254.169.254 is refused at the hop that matters.
